# Dream Texts

Allows changing dream texts and conditions.

Install on all clients and on the server if you want to sync the dreams (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

# Usage

After loading a world, `dream_texts.yaml` is generated to the config folder.

The file can be modified while in the game. If installed on server, then the server file is applied to all clients.

When sleeping, the game randomly selects one of the available dreams and then does the random chance roll for that dream.

This means the random chances are not added together but checked individually.
